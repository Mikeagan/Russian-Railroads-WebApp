</md-button>

<h2>Game Setup</h2>
Set the game up for 2 players. The Turn Order and Starting Bonus cards
as well as the Last Round marker are not required.
<ul>
    <li>Take <strong>5</strong> instead of just one coin</li>
    <li>Give Emil a supply of 6 workers</li>
    <li>Put 2 additional workers for Emil next to the 50 space of the
        score track</li>
</ul>
The field <strong>Take 2 Coins</strong> is <strong>not</strong>
available in the solo game.

<h2>Game Sequence</h2>
At the beginning of a round, the application will ask you for the costs of
the public engineer (1 or 2 workers or 1 coin). In later rounds you will
also be asked about your points. If they are greater 50 or 150, Emil will
get another worker each. This will usually happen between rounds in the scoring
phase.

<p>
Emil will always start the round and wants to take an action. Which action it
is will be shown by the application including the costs of it. You must decide
whether Emil can take the action or not. In case he can, put the according
workers or a coin from the general supply on that field and make your turn.
</p>

<strong>
    In case you accepted or rejected the action by mistake, you can remove it
    from the discard pile list by pressing
    <md-icon class="material-icons">clear</md-icon> or
    <md-icon class="material-icons">check</md-icon> next to the name in the
    list.
</strong>

<p>
The game ends after 6 (or 5 rounds if you play with the coal module). All
workers available to Emil, the number of drawable cards, remaining rounds
and your points are displayed in the toolbar.
</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Emil does not need any many. He simply takes it from the general supply.</li>
    <li>In case Emil don't have enough workers he will pass.</li>
    <li>As soon as you reach 50+ or 150+ points, Emil will get another worker
        which he is allowed to use immediately (as long he has not passed yet).
    </li>
    <li>Emil collects locomotives and engineers. He always takes the locomotive
        with the lowest number. If no locomotives are available anymore he
        will take the factory with the lowest number.</li>
    <li>The number of engineers gathered by Emil are only required to check
        the majority of engineers for the according points.
    </li>
</ul>
